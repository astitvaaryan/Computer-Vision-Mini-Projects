## Noise Addition, Denoising, and Canny Edge Detection

### Description
In this project, we explore image pre-processing techniques by adding and denoising noise and implementing an edge detection algorithm.

- **Tasks**:
  1. Add impulse (salt-and-pepper) and Gaussian noise to images using custom implementations.
  2. Denoise images using Box, Gaussian, and Median filters, implemented from scratch.
  3. Develop a custom Canny Edge Detector and compare it with OpenCVâ€™s implementation using RMSE.

## Gaussian Pyramid, Image Blending, and Corner Detection

### Description
This project involves multi-scale image processing and feature detection using pyramid and corner detection methods.

- **Tasks**:
  1. Implement Gaussian Pyramid downsampling and compare it with OpenCV resizing.
  2. Perform Laplacian Pyramid-based image blending for seamless fusion.
  3. Implement Harris and Hessian Corner Detection algorithms for feature extraction.

## Panorama Stitching

### Description
This project focuses on creating seamless panoramas by stitching multiple images together.

- **Tasks**:
  1. Implement feature matching and transformations to merge 5-6 images into panoramas.

## Optical Flow and Image Warping

### Description
This project explores motion estimation and warping using optical flow techniques.

- **Tasks**:
  1. Implement the Lucas-Kanade optical flow algorithm for tracking motion between video frames.
  2. Perform image warping based on computed optical flow to align video frames.

## Stereo Vision and Disparity Maps

### Description
This project delves into 3D vision concepts by analyzing stereo image pairs and reconstructing disparity maps.

- **Tasks**:
  1. Match points between stereo image pairs using SIFT feature matching.
  2. Estimate camera matrices and perform stereo rectification.
  3. Generate disparity maps from rectified images.
